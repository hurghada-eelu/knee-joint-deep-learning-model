# knee-joint-deep-learning-model
The goal of this project is to develop an automated system that can detect and localize the knee joint in medical images (like X-rays or MRIs) and use this information to diagnose diseases such as osteoarthritis.
## Running the Notebook and Executing Cells

**Before you begin:**

1. **Download the dataset:**

   * Visit the following website and download the `dataset.zip` file: [dataset.zip](https://eeluedueg-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/amohamedessa_eelu_edu_eg/EbQNvm3CprxFmHISjZMxKOEBMTrns3RD7auZM1GBqYEXNA?e=QHQchI)
   * Make sure to save the downloaded `dataset.zip` file in the same directory as your Jupyter notebook file (`.ipynb`) before running the notebook.
2. **Run the Notebook:**


**Important Note:**

* Ensure the `dataset.zip` file is uploaded to the same directory as your notebook before running it, especially if your code relies on the data within the zip file.

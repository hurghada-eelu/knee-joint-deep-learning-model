# knee-joint-deep-learning-model
The goal of this project is to develop an automated system that can detect and localize the knee joint in medical images (like X-rays or MRIs) and use this information to diagnose diseases such as osteoarthritis.
## Running the Notebook and Executing Cells

**Before you begin:**

1. **Download the dataset:**

   * Visit the following website and download the `dataset.zip` file: [dataset.zip](https://eeluedueg-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/amohamedessa_eelu_edu_eg/EbQNvm3CprxFmHISjZMxKOEBMTrns3RD7auZM1GBqYEXNA?e=QHQchI)
   * Make sure to save the downloaded `dataset.zip` file in the same directory as your Jupyter notebook file (`.ipynb`) before running the notebook.
2. **Run the Notebook:**

There are two main ways to run a Jupyter Notebook, depending on your environment:

* **Local Notebook:**
    * Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing your notebook file (`.ipynb`).
    * Run the following command, replacing `your_notebook.ipynb` with the actual filename of your notebook:
        ```
        jupyter notebook your_notebook.ipynb
        ```
    * This will launch a web interface where you can interact with your notebook.

* **Jupyter Notebook Platforms (Google Colab etc.):**
    * These platforms typically have a "Run" button or menu option within the user interface itself. Clicking this will execute the entire notebook.


3. **Executing Cells:**

Once your notebook is running, you can execute individual cells or the entire notebook:

* **Individual Cells:**
    * Click on the "Run" button located at the top of each code cell. This will execute the code within that cell and display the results below.

* **Entire Notebook:**
    * Look for a button or menu option labeled "Run All" or "Run All Cells" (might vary based on the platform). Clicking this will execute all the code cells in your notebook sequentially, from top to bottom.


**Important Note:**

* Ensure the `dataset.zip` file is uploaded to the same directory as your notebook before running it, especially if your code relies on the data within the zip file.
